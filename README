This is my take on the classic Nibbles/Snakes game for Android mobile phones, where you direct the snake North, South, East or West to eat the apples and squeeze between the walls.

If you just want to play the game, grab it here

This code is free to use and modify.  If you have any questions, contact me on my blog.
You should be able to pull this code into Eclipse as an Android project, assuming you have the Android SDK installed.  I hope it works equally well on Mac and Linux as PC.

Notes - The game loop is based on James Daniello's excellent Simple Java Android Game Loop ( http://blorb.tumblr.com/post/236799414/simple-java-android-game-loop ). It is NOT based on the Snakes sample included in the Android SDK - I found this to suffer flickering graphics and unresponsive controls, whereas using James's game loop and my own touch listener I've been able to make something much more stable and responsive.
